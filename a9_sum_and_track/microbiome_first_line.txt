1 We analyzed the composition of microbial communities in the soil using 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing.For this analysis, we collected12repeats for each samples from cultureWe obtained an average read count per sample of 3935(standard deviation (SD)1658.64).the numbers of OTU, generally ranged between 43 and 224 per sample with an average of 150(SD 43)The majority of OTU belonged to the phyla Proteobacteria(30.59% with sd 0.088) Chloroflexi(27.03% with sd 0.16) Saccharibacteria(13.93% with sd 0.13) Parcubacteria(8.35% with sd 0.048) and Actinobacteria(6.84% with sd 0.033) .
